# Project Brief: KindroidAI Golang Client

## Project Name
KindroidAI - Golang Client by Project Harmony.AI

## Overview
This project is an unofficial API client for KindroidAI, written in Golang. It provides a programmatic interface to interact with the KindroidAI API, based on their public API documentation.

## Current Status
The project is currently in a **pre-release** state. It is described as "barebone" and not yet optimized for productive usage in Golang applications. Basic API functionality has been implemented and tested.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- Implement API methods according to KindroidAI's public documentation.
- Provide a functional and easy-to-use Golang client for KindroidAI.
- Ensure basic functionality and provide comprehensive tests.
- Long-term vision (from Project Harmony.AI): Elevating Human-to-AI Interaction beyond known boundaries by establishing technologies that minimize biological and technological barriers.

## Project Scope
- **In Scope**:
    - Implementation of core KindroidAI API methods (e.g., SendMessage, ChatBreak).
    - Basic client setup and interaction.
    - Unit testing for implemented API methods.
    - Example usage demonstrating core functionality.
- **Out of Scope (for current phase)**:
    - Advanced error handling and retry mechanisms.
    - Comprehensive Golang struct handling for all API responses/requests.
    - Production-ready optimizations (e.g., performance, concurrency).
    - Full API coverage beyond basic chat functionalities.

## Source of Truth
The primary source of truth for the API implementation is KindroidAI's public API reference: [KindroidAI API](https://docs.kindroid.ai/api-documentation).
