# Technical Context: KindroidAI Golang Client

## Technologies Used
- **Golang**: The primary programming language for the client library.
    - **Version**: Go 1.22 (as specified in `go.mod`).
- **Standard Library**:
    - `net/http`: For making HTTP requests to the KindroidAI API.
    - `encoding/json`: For marshaling and unmarshaling JSON payloads.
    - `fmt`: For formatted I/O and error messages.
    - `bytes`, `io`, `os`, `bufio`: Used in the client and example application for various I/O operations.
- **Third-party Libraries**:
    - `github.com/stretchr/testify`: A popular Go testing framework used for assertions and test suite management.
        - `github.com/davecgh/go-spew` (indirect dependency of testify)
        - `github.com/pmezard/go-difflib` (indirect dependency of testify)
        - `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (indirect dependency of testify)

## Development Setup
- **Go Environment**: A working Go development environment (Go 1.22 or later) is required.
- **Dependencies**: Dependencies are managed via Go Modules. They can be fetched using `go get github.com/harmony-ai-solutions/KindroidAI-Golang` or `go mod tidy`.
- **API Credentials**: The KindroidAI API Key and Kindroid ID are required for interaction. These are expected to be set as environment variables (`KINDROID_API_KEY`, `KINDROID_AI_ID`) for the example application.

## Technical Constraints
- **KindroidAI API Dependency**: The client's functionality is entirely dependent on the availability and stability of the KindroidAI public API.
- **JSON-based Communication**: All data exchange must conform to JSON format as required by the KindroidAI API.
- **Bearer Token Security**: The API key must be securely handled and transmitted as a Bearer token.
- **Pre-release Limitations**: As a pre-release, the current implementation might lack robust error handling, advanced features, or comprehensive struct definitions for all API responses, which are common in production-ready clients.

## Dependencies
- **Runtime Dependencies**: None beyond the standard Go runtime and the KindroidAI API service.
- **Development/Test Dependencies**: `github.com/stretchr/testify` for testing.

## Tool Usage Patterns
- **`go get`**: For installing the module as a dependency.
- **`go run`**: For executing the example application.
- **`go test`**: For running the unit tests.
