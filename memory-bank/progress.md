# Progress: KindroidAI Golang Client

## What works
- **Basic API Functionality**: The client successfully implements `SendMessage` and `ChatBreak` methods for interacting with the KindroidAI API.
- **API Communication**: Correctly handles HTTP POST requests, JSON serialization of request bodies, and bearer token authentication.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A robust test suite using `httptest` and `testify` ensures the client's methods behave as expected against mocked API responses. This includes validation of request methods, headers, and bodies.
- **Example Application**: The `example.go` provides a fully functional command-line chat application demonstrating how to use the client, including handling API keys from environment variables and chat reset functionality.
- **Dependency Management**: Go Modules are correctly configured and manage project dependencies.
- **New API Endpoints Implemented**:
    - `CheckUserSubscription()`: Retrieves user subscription information.
    - `AudioInference(messageID string)`: Sends an audio inference request.
    - Enhanced `SendMessageAdvanced(options SendMessageOptions)`: Supports multimedia and streaming options.
    - `GetChatHistory(ctx context.Context, aiID string, limit int)`: Retrieves and decrypts chat history from Firestore.
- **Type Safety**: Dedicated Go structs (`SubscriptionInfo`, `SendMessageOptions`, `AudioInferenceRequest`, `ChatMessage`) are now used for API request and response payloads, improving type safety and readability.
- **Updated Tests**: Existing tests have been updated, and new tests have been added for `CheckUserSubscription`, `AudioInference`, `SendMessageAdvanced`, and JWT parsing.
- **Firestore Integration**: The client can now communicate with Google's Firestore to fetch data.
- **Message Decryption**: The client can decrypt encrypted chat messages using the User ID as the key.
- **Flexible Authentication**: The client now supports both JWTs and static API keys (with a `KINDROID_USER_ID` environment variable) for authentication.

## What's left to build
- **Production Readiness**: While significant progress has been made on type safety and API coverage, further optimization for productive usage might be needed (e.g., more robust error handling, concurrency).
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more granular error handling, potentially including custom error types for different API error scenarios.
- **Full API Coverage**: Extend the client to cover all available endpoints and functionalities of the KindroidAI public API beyond the currently implemented ones.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and Apidocs are "coming soon" as per the `README.md`. This needs to be developed beyond the README updates.
- **Concurrency and Performance**: Consider optimizations for concurrent API calls and overall performance if needed for high-throughput applications.

## Current Status
The project is in a **functional pre-release state with significantly expanded API coverage**. The core API interaction logic is sound and well-tested, now including newly discovered endpoints, enhanced messaging capabilities, and the ability to retrieve and decrypt chat history. The primary remaining work involves further enhancing the client for production use and comprehensive documentation.

## Known Issues
- The current implementation returns raw string responses for `SendMessageAdvanced`, which requires manual parsing by the consumer. This is a known limitation that could be addressed by implementing more specific response structs if the API provides structured JSON responses for messages.
- Error messages from the API are currently returned as generic HTTP error strings, lacking specific details that could aid debugging.
- **Undocumented APIs**: `CheckUserSubscription`, `AudioInference`, and `GetChatHistory` methods, along with some `SendMessageAdvanced` options, are based on reverse-engineered HAR logs and are not part of the official KindroidAI API documentation. They may change or be removed without notice and should be used with caution in production environments.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Focus**: The initial development focused on quickly getting basic API interaction working and thoroughly testing it.
- **Current Phase**: Expanded API coverage based on Network analysis, introduced type-safe structs, and updated testing.
- **Future Direction**: The next phase of development will shift towards improving the developer experience by introducing strong typing for API payloads and expanding the client's capabilities.
